PANENE
--

PANENE (Progressive Approximate k-NEarest NEighbors) is a novel algorithm for the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) problem. In contrast to previous algorithms such as [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [FLANN](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/), or many others from [this benchmark](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks#evaluated), PANENE is *progressive*: it can process multiple mini-batches *online* while keeping each iteration bounded in time.

The algorithm is described in the paper: J. Jo, J. Seo and J. -D. Fekete, "PANENE: A Progressive Algorithm for Indexing and Querying Approximate k-Nearest Neighbors," in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, vol. 26, no. 2, pp. 1347-1360, 1 Feb. 2020, doi: [10.1109/TVCG.2018.2869149](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2869149).

PANENE consists of two modules:
- *A progressive k-d tree* that allows you to index a batch of data into multiple k-d trees (i.e., a k-d tree forest) and query the neighbors of an arbitrary point
- *A KNN table* that allows you to lookup the neighbors of a training point in a constant time

The running time of both modules can be controlled by specifiying the allowed number of operations (i.e., *ops*). See the examples below.

# Installation

The source code was compiled and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and macOS. The instructions below assume that you are using Ubuntu 16.04. If you are using macOS, please use an appropriate package manager (e.g., `brew` instead of `apt`)

Prerequisites:
- A C++ compiler with OpenMP and C++ 11 support
- Python 3.6 (we recommend to use Anaconda)
- CMake

Download the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e-/PANENE.git
cd PANENE
```

Check if the system has CMake:
```bash
cmake

# if you don't have CMake, run the following command:
sudo apt install cmake
```

Check if the system has g++. Note that PANENE requires the OpenMP support. Most recent compilers support it by default:
```bash
g++

# if you don't have g++, run the following command:
sudo apt install g++
```

Build the source code:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Install PANENE:
```bash
sudo make install
```

Update the shared library links after installation:
```bash
sudo ldconfig
```

# Running the Benchmark

Download the glove dataset and generate training and testing data (from the root directory):
```bash
cd data
./download.sh glove
```

Compute the exact neighbors of the testing data (this can take a while):
```bash
cp ../build/benchmark/answer .
./answer.sh glove
```

Run one of benchmarks (`kd_tree_benchmark` or `knn_table_benchmark`):
```bash
cd ..
cd build/benchmark
./kd_tree_benchmark
cat log.tsv
```

# Compile on Windows

If you are using Windows, the easiest way to use PANENE is compiling it using Visual Studio, since Visual Studio (>= 15) supports CMakeLists.txt

- Clone the repository
- Open Visual Studio
- Click on [File] -> [Open] -> [Folder] and select the directory
- Find the root CMakeLists.txt in Solution Explorer, right-click it, and select [Cache] -> [Generate Cache]
- Choose a target executable on the upper toolbar and Run

If you are running benchmarks, you must specify the absolute path of data files. This is because Visual Stduio compiles and runs executables in a temporary folder by default, so you need to specifiy the absolute path to make the executables locate the data.

Please see the main function of benchmark/kd_tree_benchmark.cpp and benchmark/knn_table_benchmark.cpp.
